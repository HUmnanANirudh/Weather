## Whats Under the Hood
-React: Because apparently, using raw JavaScript is too 2001. We’ve embraced the React life, complete with its hooks, states, and fancy components.

-Tailwind CSS: For those who like their styles to be as simple as their daily decisions. The utility-first approach means you can spend less time styling and more time ignoring this project.

-OpenWeather API: This is our go-to for weather forecasts.

-Axios: This library handles our HTTP requests because fetch was feeling a little too basic.

-GitHub Pages:Because nothing says “professional” like a free hosting service.
